## Unit 1: Creating Java Programs
- **Key Concepts**: Basic Java program structure, compiling, and running Java applications.
- **Answer Summary**: Java programs are structured in classes and must contain a `main` method as the entry point.

## Unit 2: Using Data
- **Key Concepts**: Primitive data types, variables, type conversion.
- **Answer Summary**: Java supports several primitive data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc. Variables must be declared with a specific data type.

## Unit 3: Using Methods and Classes
- **Key Concepts**: Method declaration, parameters, return types, class definitions.
- **Answer Summary**: Methods encapsulate functionality and can accept parameters and return values. Classes are blueprints for creating objects.

## Unit 4: More Object Concepts
- **Key Concepts**: Encapsulation, access modifiers, constructors.
- **Answer Summary**: Encapsulation restricts access to certain components of a class, enhancing data hiding. Constructors initialize new objects.

## Unit 5: Making Decisions
- **Key Concepts**: Conditional statements (if, switch).
- **Answer Summary**: Decision-making structures allow the program to execute different paths based on conditions.

## Unit 6: Looping
- **Key Concepts**: For loops, while loops, do-while loops.
- **Answer Summary**: Loops enable repeated execution of code blocks until a condition is met, improving code efficiency.

## Unit 7: Characters, Strings & String Builder
- **Key Concepts**: String manipulation, StringBuilder class.
- **Answer Summary**: Strings are immutable in Java; StringBuilder allows for mutable sequences of characters.

## Unit 8: Arrays
- **Key Concepts**: Array declaration, initialization, and access.
- **Answer Summary**: Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable and can hold both primitive types and objects.

## Unit 9: Advanced Array Topics
- **Key Concepts**: Multidimensional arrays, array methods.
- **Answer Summary**: Multidimensional arrays can be used to represent matrices or grids, and Java provides methods for array manipulation.

## Unit 10: Intro to Inheritance
- **Key Concepts**: Base classes and derived classes.
- **Answer Summary**: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class, facilitating code reuse.

## Unit 11: Advanced Inheritance Concepts
- **Key Concepts**: Abstract classes, interfaces.
- **Answer Summary**: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, while interfaces define a contract for classes to implement methods.

## Unit 12: Exception Handling
- **Key Concepts**: Try-catch blocks, throw, throws.
- **Answer Summary**: Exception handling is used to manage errors gracefully, allowing a program to continue running even when an error occurs.

## Unit 13: File Input & Output
- **Key Concepts**: Reading and writing files in Java.
- **Answer Summary**: Java provides classes for file I/O, enabling data persistence beyond program execution.

## Unit 14: Intro to Swing Components
- **Key Concepts**: Creating GUI applications using Swing.
- **Answer Summary**: Swing provides a rich set of components for building graphical user interfaces in Java.
